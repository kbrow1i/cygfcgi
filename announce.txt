The following packages have been updated in the Cygwin distribution:

* fcgi-2.4.0-3
* libfcgi0-2.4.0-3
* libfcgi-devel-2.4.0-3

FastCGI is a fast, open, and secure Web server interface that solves the performance problems inherent in CGI, without introducing the overhead and complexity of proprietary APIs.

For 64-bit Cygwin this is the first release of fcgi.  For 32-bit Cygwin this is just a rebuild of 2.4.0-2 with gcc 4.9.2-2.
